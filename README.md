# Start-Page
Just a quick edit of Jarvvski [Start-Page](https://github.com/Jarvvski/Start-Page).

# Changes
- Tweaked design and colours a little bit
- Fully responsive
- Click on the three dots on the bottom right to switch colour palette

# Usage
1. Edit the HTML file and add your own custom links
2. Change colours in the different CSS files

Check [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/) to find out how to use it with your specific browser.

# Issues
The custom colours will be resetted once you reload the page, hence they are pretty useless
